- 👋 Hi, I’m @ScottCarnahan
- 👀 I’m interested in ... moonshine, vertex algebras, conformal field theory, and related areas of algebra and geometry
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... lean4, mathlib4
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... verified proofs of some vertex-algebraic theorems, e.g., Aut(V^\natural) is a finite simple group (cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15391)
- 📫 How to reach me ... zulip PM seems to work for lean stuff.  Otherwise, tsukuba email, I guess.
